Observability is the capability to continuously generate and discover actionable insights based on signals from the system under observation with the goal to influence the system. In this book you will learn about telemetry, destinations, and how to use different signal types (logs, metrics, traces, profiles).

The first couple of chapters will soon be available via the [Manning MEAP Program](https://www.manning.com/meap-program). Here is the WIP table of contents:

## Ch 1. End-to-end Observability Example
In the context of this book we focus on cloud native environments such as Kubernetes or serverless offerings such as AWS Lambda. We mainly use open source observability tooling so that you can try out everything without license costs. However, it is important that while we use open source tooling to show the concepts in action, they are universally applicable. In this chapter we have a look at an end-to-end example and define terminology.

* Introducing Observability
* Example Microservices App
* Cloud Native Challenges and How Observability Helps

## Ch 2. Signal Types
In this chapter we review different signal types most often used, how to instrument and collect each, and discuss the costs and benefits of doing that. With observability you want to take an Return-On-Investment (ROI) driven approach. In other words, you need to understand the costs of each signal type and what it enables you to do.

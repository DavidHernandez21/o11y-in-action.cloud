# Chapter 2: Signal Types
In this chapter we review different signal types most often used, 
how to instrument and collect each, and discuss the costs and benefits of doing 
that. With observability you want to take an Return-On-Investment (ROI) driven
approach. In other words, you need to understand the costs of each signal type 
and what it enables you to do.

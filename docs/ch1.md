# Chapter 1: End-to-end Observability Example

In the context of this book we focus on cloud native environments such as 
Kubernetes and serverless offerings (such as FaaS like AWS Lambda). We mainly
use open source observability tooling (Grafana, Prometheus, Jaeger) so that 
you can try out everything without license costs. While it is important that
we use open source tooling to show the concepts in action, they are universally
applicable (that is, using any of the commerical offerings). 
In this chapter we have a look at an end-to-end example and define terminology,
from sources to agents to destinations.
